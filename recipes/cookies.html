    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>creaming together softened butter and white sugar until smooth, then add a touch of molasses for a rich, 
    slightly caramel flavor. Beat in the eggs one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated. In a separate 
    bowl, whisk together flour, a pinch of salt, a dash of cinnamon, and baking soda to evenly distribute the 
    dry ingredients. Gradually add the dry mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Fold in 
    chopped walnuts and chocolate pieces to add crunch and bursts of melted chocolate throughout. </p>
    
    <p>Scoop the dough onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper, spacing each scoop evenly, and bake in a 
    preheated oven at 350°F (175°C) for 10-12 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown but the centers 
    are still soft. Cool on the baking sheet briefly, then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. </p>
