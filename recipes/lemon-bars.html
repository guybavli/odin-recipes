    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>Mixing together softened butter and powdered sugar until smooth and creamy. Add flour and a pinch of salt, 
    combining until the mixture forms a soft dough. Press this dough into the base of a lined baking pan to form a crust. 
    Bake the crust until it's lightly golden. Meanwhile, whisk together eggs, fresh lemon juice, sugar, and a bit of flour for 
    thickness, creating a tangy lemon filling. Pour this filling over the warm crust for a custard-like 
    layer thats perfectly tart and sweet.</p>

    <p>Return the pan to the oven and bake until the filling is set and lightly golden around the edges. 
    Allow the lemon bars to cool completely in the pan, then dust with powdered sugar. Cut into squares and enjoy!</p>
